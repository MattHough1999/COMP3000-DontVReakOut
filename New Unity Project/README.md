This is a brief write up about my final project submission for COMP3000...
In this write up you will find:
A link to the video walkthrough; A link to the git repo; Information about the project and code.


## Installation/Setup

There is no installation required for the executable or project itself, however you will require SteamVR to be installed and a compatible VR headset.

### Executable
Inside the "**New Unity Project.zip**" there is a folder called **Build** It contains the executable **Don't VReak Out!.exe**.
### Project
The project has no fatal errors and should run on any machine that meets the minimum requirements.
If blender is not installed the Unity project may not render some objects. If you open the project and experience fatal errors regarding "Missing prefab(s)" check that blender is installed.

## Program Operation
To play the game you will require a VR headset and at least one VR controller (Two is recommended)
### Interactable Objects
There are many interactable objects in the scene. Every object is coloured so they are easy to distinguish and operate.
**Pale Green** Objects are grabbable, they can either be picked up and thrown around or pulled
**Pink** Objects that can move but cannot be grabbed. Doors and drawers.
**Orange** Objects are solid and cannot move/be moved.
**Buttons** Are coloured **Red** and **Green**
### Gameplay
#### Tasks
There are **tasks** given to you by the **task board**. At time of writing there are 4 tasks available. At any point you may **skip** a task by pressing the **green button** next to the task board.
**Dial The Phone** - To dial the phone, Make a fist and point with the relevant buttons on your controller. Press the numbers from the task board into the buttons on the phone.
**Store a Cup** - Take a **cup** from the desk or press the button next to the cup dispenser. Open the **correct** draw and place the cup inside. Complete the task by closing the drawer.
**Punch The Alarm** - On the wall there is a box with a **button inside**. **Punch it** to complete the task. - If the button doesn't work take a new task.
**Put The Kettle On** - Grab the kettle and place it on the **green plate**. It will boil and snap back to the original plate automatically.  If it does not boil after a few seconds try placing it more **centrally** on the plate.

### Exiting the program
There is currently no way to close the program gently. The program will close automatically after **5 minutes** of being in the office scene. If that isn't soon enough Press **Alt + Enter** To get out of full screen and click the X in the top right corner
